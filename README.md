Savvy is an scalable serverless customer feedback app - built with AWS Amplify, AWS AppSync, and Amazon DynamoDB.

## About the app

While the voting API is built with DynamoDB and AppSync, the main functionality really is within a single GraphQL resolver that sends an atomic update to DynamoDB.

This atomic update allows the DynamoDB table to stay consistent regardless of the number of other operations that are happening.

```sh
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
