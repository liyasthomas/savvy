### Get started

**How Savvy works**

Three simple steps to understand the workflow.

1. Setup

   Use one-click deploy to AWS Amplify or follow detailed instructions on GitHub repository. Update Discus short name. Customize with your own logo, colors and text.

2. Collect

   Invite your customers to your new Savvy site. They'll be able to suggest new ideas, submit feature requests or report issues they have with your product. Publish your Savvy site on any hosting service to accept public feedbacks.

3. Deliver
